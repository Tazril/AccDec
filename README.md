# AccDec

We have trained a wide residual network model over a variety of accidental images by classifying them into 3 categories :
                                1. Fatal accident
                                2. Minor accident
                                3. Safe accident
In case of Fatal accident , a notification is sent to nearest police station along with nearest hospital to send ambulance for medical help and at the same time all vehicles approaching that area are immediately notified to change their route to avoid traffic jams.
In case of Minor accident , a notification is sent to nearest hospital to send ambulance for medical help.
In case of no accident , nothing happens.
